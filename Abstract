Recruitment is a huge business which mainly focus on hiring candidates who possess relevant skills and qualifications that 
can satisfy the job profile set by the company. When a company announces for a new job opening for a particular position, 
thousands of candidates seeking for a job would mail their resumes to the respected companies for the profile. Selecting 
the right candidates from a large pool of applicants is quite a tedious task for the recruiter. To solve this issue, 
a new system is recommended such that a web application is designed whereby the resumes of the applicants are screened 
for effective selection of right and apt applicants suitable for the respected job profile. In this system, 
recruiters from various companies post the details of job vacancies available in the respected companies and applicants 
can apply for the job only in which they are interested in and later this is then screened, which still Consumes a little time. 
To ease the situation, we again check the emotional aptitude of the applicant and leads us to a final decision on whether the 
applicant is fit for the post.
